# Python_insta_api

*INSTAGRAM STATS USING PYTHON*

Instagram is a quintessential datapool. Meticulous analysis of Instagram is the
basis of the project. The project will be developed in Python3. The project will ask
for a user input. We will incorporate certain frameworks like Selenium,
beautiful soup and other API's to retrieve the userâ€™s data.
The data will be collected in the form of dictionaries with resource parameters like
the count of posts, followers and following. The data will be split to maintain a
record of these parameters extracted from datetime.
